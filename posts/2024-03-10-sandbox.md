## Sandboxing art projects

> _sandbox_: isolate (a piece of software) so that it can access only certain resources, programs, and files within a computer system.

I'm discovering that learning generative art is a lot about trial an error. It's important to understand what you're actually doing, but as part of the creating process, I find myself constantly asking _what if...?_.

Having a concept (a [starting point](/posts/2024-03-04-the-starting-point)) it's a good mechanism to focus and work with purpose. But, after all, this is art, and there should be some bandwith to just test and mess it up.

That's the reason why I've decided to have a [dedicated page](/sandbox) only for these projects without purpose. I want to revisit them, understand them again, look at the code and remember what drove me into that outcome.
