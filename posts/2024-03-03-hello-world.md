This is just meant to be the first entry, so the blog is not empty and lonely. I've always loved generative art, I read about it here and there, and for a year now I started following some artists to get inspired.

But this wasn't enough to learn generative art. Which was fine, by the way, you can enjoy things you don't understand. However, I wanted to start doing my own art... and I just didn't know where to start.

I learn better through practice. This side project is just this: a place to post what I'm doing as part of my learning process.
